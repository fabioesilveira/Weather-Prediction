## Description
A work calendar is a tool used to keep track of important dates and events related to one's work schedule. A work calendar helps individuals stay organized and ensures that they are aware of their professional commitments. With that in mind, we provide our website, my work day calendar, so users can digitally include details about their work day such as deadlines, meetings, appointments, and work shifts.
